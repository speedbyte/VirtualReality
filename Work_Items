Hi all,

It's Loc here. Now things are getting more clear for us, so I think we there are several work items we need to work on:

1. Interfacing C++ code with VREP                                               => Markus has done this I think. Thanks!
2. C++ and UDP communication                                                    => Markus has also done this. To do: Wait to test with the real data,
                                                                                   problem could be in the data format. 
3. Calculating xyz position from acceleration data (received by UDP)            => Im working on the dynamics of the quadcopter (quadcopter_dynamics.h file),
                                                                                   all contribution are welcome. Due date: 07.04 
4. Calculating angles of from gyroscope data (received by UDP)                  => Im working on the dynamics of the quadcopter (quadcopter_dynamics.h file),
                                                                                   all contribution are welcome. Due date: 07.04
5. Control algorithms of the quadcopter are not yet defined (how will           => Abraham, I think you can work on this... Comments are welcome :D. Due date 12.04 
   it react to disturbances)                                                       (before Easter :D)
6. Test (drag the quadcopter out of its position and see if it returns          => Team. Due date: 23.04
   to the initial position)

These are what I am able to think of at the moment. More will be discussed on Monday 03.04. If you guys can think of any items, please put it in the list here.

Thank you all :D.
