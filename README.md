Project to bring a Simulink based Quadrocopter-Model to Google Cardboard VR

A quadrocopter-model based on MATLAB/Simulink will be used to show the behaviour of a quadrocopter in a virtual reality environment. The control of the object will be the movement of the head.

The virtual reality device is a android smartphone with google cardboard. A google cardboard app will be developed with Unreal Engine 4 and the Google VR Plugin. This can later be adapted to an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive device.

The communication between the smartphone and the Simulink simulation goes via UDP communication.
